Download the data set for the tutorial.2. Follow this tutorial on applying kNN to prostate cancer detection and implement all of the steps in anR Notebook. Make sure to explain each step and what it does. ( : The data set provided as part ofthis assignment has been slightly modied from the one used in the tutorial, so small deviations in theresult can be expected.)3. Once youâ€™ve complete the tutorial, try another implementation from another package, such as thepackage. Compare the accuracy of the two implementations.4. Try the function from the package to determine the accuracy of both algorithms.
